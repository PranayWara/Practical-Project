# Idea - Gun Skin Opener
The app will output the skin rarity and the gun. From these two random inputs a price will be outputted. Service 1 or my front end will display these outputs and the last five rolls.
## Service 1
### Front End
* Show current roll
* Show last 5 rolls
## Service 2 
### Skin Rarity
* Blue = £1
* Purple = £2
* Pink = £5
* Red = £20
## Service 3 
### Guns
* AK-47 = £5
* M4A4 = £3
* AWP = £4
* Glock-18 = £1
* USP-S = £2
## Service 4
### Price
* Skin Rarity Price + Gun Price
